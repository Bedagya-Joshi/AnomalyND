Roadmap for a Simple Anomaly Detection Project (5 Months, 5 Hours/Day)
This roadmap outlines a achievable final-year project for your BCA focusing on Anomaly Detection for Network Security using Machine Learning and basic Network Traffic Analysis.  With 5 months and 5 hours of daily dedication, you can build a solid foundation and showcase your skills.

Phase 1: Understanding Network Traffic Analysis (1 Month)

Activities (2 hours/day):

Learn about network protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, etc.) and their functionalities.
Explore network traffic analysis tools like Wireshark. Practice capturing and analyzing network traffic for basic understanding (source/destination IP, protocols, packet sizes).
Research common network security threats (e.g., Denial-of-Service attacks, malware) and their network traffic characteristics.
Resources:

Online tutorials on network protocols (e.g., https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/computer_networking.htm)
Wireshark documentation: https://www.wireshark.org/docs/
Network security resources like SANS Institute: https://www.sans.org/
Deliverables:

Basic understanding of network traffic analysis concepts.
Ability to capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark.
Phase 2: Exploring Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection (1.5 Months)

Activities (2 hours/day):

Learn about Machine Learning basics, focusing on supervised vs. unsupervised learning.
Understand anomaly detection techniques and their applications in network security.
Explore anomaly detection algorithms suitable for your project, like Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM. Focus on a single algorithm for simplicity.
Choose a beginner-friendly Python library for Machine Learning like scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org/
Resources:

Online courses on Machine Learning fundamentals (e.g., Coursera, edX)
Tutorials on anomaly detection with scikit-learn: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scikit_learn/scikit_learn_anomaly_detection.htm
Documentation for your chosen anomaly detection algorithm (Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM)
Deliverables:

Grasp of Machine Learning concepts, specifically anomaly detection.
Understanding of a chosen anomaly detection algorithm (Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM).
Familiarity with a Python library for Machine Learning (scikit-learn).
Phase 3: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing (1 Month)

Activities (2 hours/day):

Search for publicly available network traffic datasets suitable for anomaly detection tasks. Consider UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle datasets: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ https://www.kaggle.com/
Explore the chosen dataset and understand its features (e.g., packet size, source IP, etc.).
Learn about data preprocessing techniques for Machine Learning (handling missing values, scaling features).
Preprocess the network traffic dataset for your chosen anomaly detection algorithm.
Resources:

Public network traffic datasets (research based on your chosen anomaly)
Tutorials on data preprocessing for Machine Learning (e.g., scikit-learn documentation)
Deliverables:

A suitable network traffic dataset for anomaly detection.
Preprocessed data ready for Machine Learning model training.
Phase 4: Building and Training the Anomaly Detection Model (1 Month)

Activities (2 hours/day):

Implement your chosen anomaly detection algorithm (Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM) in Python using scikit-learn.
Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets.
Train your anomaly detection model using the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.
Resources:

Scikit-learn documentation for your chosen algorithm and evaluation metrics.
Online tutorials and examples for implementing anomaly detection models with scikit-learn.
Deliverables:

A trained anomaly detection model for network traffic anomalies.
Evaluation results demonstrating the model's performance.

Phase 5: Project Documentation and Presentation (Final Weeks) Continued

Content for your Documentation and Presentation:
Introduction: Briefly explain network security threats and the importance of anomaly detection.
Literature Review: Summarize existing research on anomaly detection techniques for network security.
Methodology: Describe the steps you took, including tools used (Wireshark, scikit-learn), chosen algorithms, and data preprocessing techniques.
Results: Present your findings, including the model's performance metrics and visualizations (if applicable).
Discussion: Analyze your results, limitations of the project, and potential future improvements.
Conclusion: Summarize your project's achievements and its contribution to understanding anomaly detection for network security.
Additional Tips:

Start Small and Gradually Increase Complexity:
Don't try to build a comprehensive security system at once. Begin with a basic model focused on a specific anomaly type.
Version Control: Use a version control system like Git to track changes in your code and data throughout the project.
Seek Help and Feedback: Don't hesitate to reach out to online communities, forums, or mentors for help with specific challenges.
Showcase Your Learning Journey: Even if you don't achieve a perfect anomaly detection system, emphasize the skills you learned in network traffic analysis, Machine Learning, and project development.
Remember: Consistency is key.  Dedicating 5 hours daily for 5 months will allow you to make significant progress and gain valuable knowledge. This project will showcase your ability to learn new concepts, apply them to a real-world problem, and document your findings effectively.  Good luck!
